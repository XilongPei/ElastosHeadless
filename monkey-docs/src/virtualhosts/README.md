# Virtual Hosts

In Web Servers context, a __Virtual Host__ is a way of __dividing__ the server into multiple independent hosts, delivering each one's associated content; each virtual host has its content placed in a separated local directory in the file system.

A very common example is that of shared-hosting service offered by many companies, in which different named sites have the same IP address. All this is possible thanks to the __Host__ HTTP header specified in the HTTP/1.1 protocol, that allows the client to specify to which named host it will target.
